# abbys-bookshelf

 When I was a kid I always read whatever I could get my hands on. I loved reading so much and I'm not really sure why I ever stopped. This love of reading has been reintroduced since the pandemic and I have been buying LOTS of books to read. As a Liberal Arts Student, I read a lot for my classes and often my desire to read is low. However! I have decided to put that aside and read for pleasure again. This blog serves as a reminder to keep reading and you can see what I've read and what I thought about each book on my bookshelf!
