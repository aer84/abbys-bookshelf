  <h4>This was the first book I read this year and I can not express how happy I am that I picked up this book.</h4>
  <p>This is truly an amazing book that kept me captivated until the end. The story was so beautifully told and you are quickly transported to Shaker Heights. There were some amazing characters that contributed to the plot in ways I didn't see coming. This story navigates through tough family relationships and secrets that are exposed. The comparison in family dynamics is also a great touch to the story as readers see how different families function and the challenges they face. I knew there was a TV show based on this book and if you have not watched it yet, definitely read the book first! Trust me, you won't regret it.</p>
