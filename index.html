<div class="intro">
  <p>My name is Abigail Roche, but I also go by Abby. As a digital media student, most of my life is spent on my phone or laptop and I love that part of my life. But I have always had a love of books, ever since I was a kid I always read whatever I could get my hands on. In middle school, I used to get in trouble for reading during class too. Now, I'm trying to reconnect with my younger self and start reading for pleasure again. Feel free to look through my bookshelf to see what I'm currently reading and what I plan to read soon.</p>
