<q>You have to be humble, and you can't pretend to be someone you're not or to know something you don't.</q>

  <h4>I've had the opportunity to work at Disney (in a very small role) but I was glad there was a leader like Iger at the company.</h4>
  <p>I'm really glad that I picked up this book. I decided to read it when I was working at Disney and before I stepped into my first leaderships position as Vice President of my fraternity. This book didn't feel like a basic autobiography where the author discusses only their successes. This was not the case with this book, where Iger provides real stories and lessons that the readers can use. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their leadership style.</p>
