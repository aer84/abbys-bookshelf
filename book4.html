<q>One of the most sinister things about apartheid was that it taught colored people that it was black people who were holding them back.</q>

  <h4>This is one of the greatest books I've ever read.</h4>
  <p>If you want to read a book that takes you from laughing to crying to discussing the root of racism, this is the book to read. I quickly read through each page and was amazed by Noah's story telling which was incredibly moving. I just love every aspect of this book, I really won't change a thing about it. Not only does the book discuss Trevor's funny childhood stories, but he is also vulnerable and discussed the sadder parts of his life often as a result of systemic racism. I would read this book to learn more about systemic issues.</p>
